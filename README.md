ACME: Applied and Computational Mathematics Emphasis

This repo contains my work from my undergraduate mathematics program.

Lab specs, file templates, and other files can be found at https://acme.byu.edu/.

Volume 1 and Volume 2 are how the first year of the core program are divided in both theory and labs.
